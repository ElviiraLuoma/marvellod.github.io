           <h3><b>WHO/</b></h3>
           <p>As the idea of relationship is of utmost importance in our project, we wanted to use standards which also put a focus on the relationship aspect. For this matter, the <b>FOAF</b> standard has been a great option (even obvious from its name: friend of a friend). We also decided to use <b>Person Core Vocabulary</b> for the additional data about the personâ€™s citizenship and locations. Since the <b>FOAF</b> standard does not have exact vocabulary for date of birth and only includes a vague age and birthday property, we decided to use <b>Core Concepts Ontology</b> for this part, because the era in which the author and illustrator worked matter in the scope of our project. The <b>Core Concepts Ontology</b> also provides some subjects intrinsic to out study, most importantly including <em>notablyAssociatedWith</em>, which is of utmost importance to this project.

           <h3><b>WHERE/</b></h3>
           <p>As for the description of the entity "Place", we have resorted to the most widely used models: <b>GeoNames</b>, <b>DBPedia</b> and <b>Basic Geo Vocabulary</b>.
<b>GeoNames</b> has proven to be a very useful tool as it allows to provide geospatial semantic information on the World Wide Web. This is made possible by the large amount of toponyms <b>GeoNames</b>, each of which is assigned a unique URI. This tool has therefore allowed us to describe with extreme precision the place that is relevant to us, namely London. The simplicity of the <b>Basic Geo Vocabulary</b> was particularly appropriate as it provided us with a namespace with which to represent the latitude and longitude of our place of interest. Finally, we resorted to <b>DBPedia</b> to fill in some gaps of the two previous models (i.e. it was important for us to describe the country, in which all the events involving our people occured).

           <h3><b>WHEN/</b></h3>
           <p>Since in our project the date that assumes the main importance is the year (e.g. the year in which Quentin Blake and Roald Dahl started collaborating, the year in which one of their books was published), we represented our dates using the specified standard from the <b>Schema Vocabulary</b>. Specifically, the formats we used were YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD. In the conceptual model we have therefore welcomed the standards that accept the aforementioned format.

           <h3><b>WHAT/</b></h3>
           <p>In order to describe our objects in the most profound way our aim was to use vocabularies that would give us the necessary properties in order to get the most accurate and coherent identification of our sources. We have tried to use the pre-existent ontologies in the field of cultural heritage as much as possible due to them being already popular and widely recognized. For clarity, we have labelled and grouped our objects as books, video material, archival documents and artefacts.</p>
           <ul>
           <li>
           <h4><em>Books</em></h4>
           <p>Since books are the most obvious concretization of the concepts of author - illustrator relationship, it was fundamental to dedicate space to the literary genre and to the description of the characters that became iconic thanks to the strength of this collaboration. We therefore took advantage of the adaptability of the <b>DBpedia</b>, <b>Schema</b>, and <b>DC</b> models. To emphasize the illustrative aspect, highlight the characters relevance and in general to describe our books, <b>Schema</b> resulted to be the best solution since it provided precise and appropriate predicates related to the above-mentioned meaningful aspects.
           </p></li>
           <li>
           <h4><em>Video Material</em></h4>
           <p>For the objects labelled as video material we decided to focus on models that are widely used when dealing with audiovisual material. These models ended up being <b>EBUCore</b> and <b>DC</b>. <b>EBUCore</b> is a set of both descriptive and technical metadata created by EBU (European Broadcasting Union) specifically for audiovisual content.</p></li>
           <li>
           <h4><em>Archival Documents</em></h4>
           <p>To describe our archival documents, we were looking for models with which we could describe both of our items belonging to this category, an article and a stamp, as detailed as possible. Thus, we ended up using <b>DCMI</b> due to it being very widely used and extremely diverse.</p></li>
           <li>
           <h4><em>Artefacts</em></h4>
           <p>For describing our artefacts, a sandal and a sculpture, we wanted to choose an ontology that could be used to describe both of our very different items. Hence, we used <b>CIDOC CRM</b>. It is widely used especially in the context of museums. <b>CIDOC CRM</b> is final product of the International Committee for Documentation (CIDOC), a committee at the International Council of Museums (ICOM).</p></li>
